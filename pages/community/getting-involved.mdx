# How to contribute

## Identity Providers

If you're an identity provider and want to integrate with the Gitcoin Passport check out the documentation for Integrating a new stamp into the Passport.

[Creating a new Stamp](../stamps/integrating-a-new-stamp.md)


## Scoring Providers

If you're interested in helping establish scoring mechanisms for Passports or building mechanisms that help apps and communities to build strong sybil resistance we'd love to hear from you.

It's our hope that there are many scoring mechanisms built on top of the base Passport data and that communities can tailor their needs accordingly.

Check out the [Passport scoring documentation](https://github.com/gitcoinco/passport-sdk/tree/main/packages/scorer) to get started.
